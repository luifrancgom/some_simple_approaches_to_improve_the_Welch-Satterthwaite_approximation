The WS option is typically used in design of experiments and metrology. However, it has been pointing out in many references the multiple limitations of the inferences based on the WS approximation. Three novel  estimators of the effective degree of freedom of a non-negative linear combination of $\\chi^2$ distributions are given. We also study some theoretical properties of the proposed estimators. Additionally, through several Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the bias, variance, and mean square error of the proposed estimators under (very) small and moderate sample sizes. The proposed estimators have a much better performance than the WS proposal  and his implications. Finally, two applications are presented in which the proposed estimators help to improve the performance of some interval estimation and hypothesis testing procedures.\nkeywords: \n  - Asymmetric distributions\n  - Unbiased estimation\n  - Consistent estimation\n  - Monte Carlo simulation\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\nformat:\n  elsevier-pdf:\n    keep-tex: true\n    journal:\n      name: Journal Name\n      formatting: preprint\n      model: 3p\n      cite-style: authoryear\n---\n\n\n\n# Critical aspects of the WS approach\n\n@lloyd_2-sample_2013 proposed basically three numerical experiments that pointed out some weak points of the two-sample t-distribution test based on the WS approach. He assumed, in his first experiment, that the exact proportion between the variances of two population is known. In our view, it is rare in practice to known it. So, we will remake that simulation but we are not assuming that the variance proportion is known because we believe that it gives us a more realistic idea of the performance of the two-sample t-distribution test under the WS approximation.\n\nNow, we describe the plan of this initial simulation. We use the following proportions between the variances, $\\rho = 2,4,6,8,10$. Also, we will assume that the two samples have the same size, $n$, and generate random samples of sizes $n = 2,3,\\cdots,12$. In the next step, for each pair of $\\rho$ and $n$, we will build the sampling distribution of the two-sample t-test approximation based on $R=10000$ replications but we are not using a previously calculated and fixed value of $\\nu$ given by the WS approach as @lloyd_2-sample_2013 did it. Finally, we calculate the empirical proportion of ...\n\n$$R = 10000, \\alpha = 0.1 \\text{ and } 0.05$$\n\n$$m_1,m_2 , \\text{based on a fixed n=6 and } \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{\\sigma_1^2} = 2$$\n\n$$t_{0.05,\\hat{\\nu}^j}, t_{0.95,\\hat{\\nu}^j},\\text{where } \\hat{\\nu}^j \\text{ is d.f calculated by the WS approach.}$$\n\n$$F_{T}: \\text{\\ Empirical Cumulative Distribution of the t-test}$$\n\n$$\\hat{\\alpha}_j = F_{T}(t_{0.05,\\hat{\\nu}^j}) + ( 1 - F_{T}( t_{0.95,\\hat{\\nu}^j})), \\text{\\ Type I Error based on WS approach}$$\n\nWe want to assess the proportion of $\\hat{\\alpha}_j$ that are smaller or bigger than $\\alpha$ in $d=0.1$ in a relative way:\n\n$$\\frac{|\\hat{\\alpha}_j - \\alpha|}{\\alpha} > 0.1$$\n\n# Template for guidance\n\nPlease make sure that your manuscript follows the guidelines in the \nGuide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to \ntypeset your manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, \nunless you are submitting to a camera-ready copy (CRC) journal.\n\nFor detailed instructions regarding the elsevier article class, see   <https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions>\n\n# Bibliography styles\n\nHere are two sample references: @lloyd_2-sample_2013\n\nBy default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style, set in `classoption` variable in YAML. \nYou can sets extra options with `natbiboptions` variable in YAML header. Example \n\n```\nnatbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon\n```\n\nThere are various more specific bibliography styles available at\n<https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files>. \nTo use one of these, add it in the header using, for example, `biblio-style: model1-num-names`.\n\n## Using CSL \n\nIf `cite-method` is set to `citeproc` in `elsevier_article()`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`. In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. By default, this template will provide an appropriate style, but alternative `csl` files are available from <https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier>. These can be downloaded\nand stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.\n\n# Equations\n\nHere is an equation:\n$$ \n  f_{X}(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\n  \\left(\\frac{x}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\alpha-1}\n  e^{-\\left(\\frac{x}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\alpha}}; \n  \\alpha,\\beta,x > 0 .\n$$\n\nInline equations work as well: $\\sum_{i = 2}^\\infty\\{\\alpha_i^\\beta\\}$\n\n# Figures and tables\n\n@fig-meaningless is generated using an R chunk.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A meaningless scatterplot](some_simple_approaches_to_improve_the_Welch-Satterthwaite_approximation_files/figure-pdf/fig-meaningless-1.pdf){#fig-meaningless fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Tables coming from R\n\nTables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in @tbl-simple example.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-simple .cell tbl-cap='Caption centered above table'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|                  |  mpg| cyl| disp|  hp|\n|:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|---:|\n|Mazda RX4         | 21.0|   6|  160| 110|\n|Mazda RX4 Wag     | 21.0|   6|  160| 110|\n|Datsun 710        | 22.8|   4|  108|  93|\n|Hornet 4 Drive    | 21.4|   6|  258| 110|\n|Hornet Sportabout | 18.7|   8|  360| 175|\n|Valiant           | 18.1|   6|  225| 105|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# References {-}\n",
